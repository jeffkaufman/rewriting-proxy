Simple code for running a proxy that changes responses.  Probably not robust
enough for production use, but good for experimenting.

In one terminal:

    $ python proxy.py localhost 8080 to_uppercase

In another terminal:

    $ http_proxy=localhost:8024 curl -D- http://www.example.com

Gzipped responses are automatically unzipped before being passed to your
rewriting code.
